/* With the Stage as a Castmember (how poetic/pretentious does that sound?) we can set up constructors
and destructors for the window itself, thereby allowing us to wrap all our lib behaviour up nice and tight
and we don't have to add anything special or unusual for its de/allocation, when we WRAP it's purged like 
everything else and destroyed appropriately.

Its update function throttles the framerate, and flips the screen. */
